In the last decades the application of small satellites has increased substantially due to their wide use in technological,
scientific and commercial domains. The coming of the "New Space Economy" has led to the opening of the
market to small companies whose technological challenge is to develop miniaturized systems with high reliability and
performance. Furthermore, the number of orbiting CubeSats has increased a lot, in fact it has more than tripled over
the last few years, so they have become an interesting subject of study. Proximity navigation systems for autonomous
small satellites are continuously examined, due to their effectiveness for several applications, e.g. related to on-orbit
servicing.
In particular, this paper is concerned with the design and development of a test for an autonomous docking maneuver
between CubeSats mock-ups to be performed on a parabolic flight in order to take advantage of a reduced-gravity
environment. The main challenge of the proposed experiment lies in the dimension of the satellites involved, that
implies the use of a miniaturized Guidance Navigation and Control system. The GNC system, based on a cold-gas
propulsion subsystem and reaction wheels, will be used to perform proximity maneuvers in order to obtain the required
alignment for the interfaces to dock. Concerning docking interfaces, two mechanical configurations are considered
and will be tested, respectively a probe-drogue and an androgynous one, both developed by the University of Padova
in order to be applied on miniaturized systems.
The development path includes tests in the laboratory for preliminary evaluations concerning the position and attitude
control software and the performances of the miniaturized propulsive system, in view of a test in microgravity
conditions. Such an experiment will be accomplished during a parabolic flight to reproduce the orbital behavior accurately
and to get relevant data. Multiple flights are planned to allow the testing of different configurations separately
and repeatedly.
This paper presents a detailed description of the experiment system, the results of the preliminary tests of the
propulsive subsystem in the laboratory.****
